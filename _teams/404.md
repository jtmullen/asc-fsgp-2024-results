The MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team (SEVT) was founded in 1986 when James Worden had a dream to create a solar powered vehicle. Since then, MIT SEVT has been dedicated to designing, building, and racing solar powered vehicles, with the goal of showcasing what is possible in the realm of sustainable transportation. SEVT proudly welcomes members from multiple majors ranging from Mechanical Engineering to Materials Science to Computer Science. As a student run organization, members gain invaluable experience in project and budget management, skills many students donâ€™t have the opportunity to learn in classes. In addition to building solar-powered vehicles, SEVT shares our passion for sustainable technology by educating the public through lectures, museum displays, energy conferences, and fairs. After previously finishing 1st in the SOV category in ASC 2021 and 2022, we have transitioned to developing our first MOV, Gemini, to compete in ASC 2024!
