SunStang is a team of engineering students from the University of Western Ontario who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of renewable energy and electrical vehicles. This team produced the Universityâ€™s first ever multiple occupancy solar powered vehicle, a task that has proven to be a challenging feat. Despite any roadblocks the team has encountered, SunStang has worked incredibly hard to produce a practical electrical vehicle to reflect what the students believe represents the future of sustainable transportation.
