Badger Solar Racing competed as a solar car team in FSGP for the first time in 2023. We are coming back this Summer to compete in our first ASC with the same, but much improved car. Our car has undergone changes including a new windshield, weight reduction, simplified electronics, along with more testing and improved race strategy.
