Dalhousie Solar Car Team started with a few engineering students in February 2021 whose goal was to get hands-on experience and innovate high-in-demand electric vehicles. In summer 2023, we became the first-ever team from the Atlantic Canadian region to compete at the Formula Sun Grand Prix. Our multidisciplinary group is what makes us successful; by embodying the core values of engineering through sportsmanship and teamwork, we are diligently learning the process of building and developing our car, NOVA. Ultimately, our objective is to promote the practicality of renewable energy, sustainability of solar power, and inspire the community for a greener future.
