The University of Kentucky Solar Car Team has now been around for 25 years, consistently competing over the years at FSGP and ASC. The last race the team competed in was the 2022 FSGP and ASC where Gato del Sol VI placed 3rd place in both competitions, this being the carâ€™s last race. Now, this year in 2024 the team will debut our seventh solar car, Gato del Sol VII.
