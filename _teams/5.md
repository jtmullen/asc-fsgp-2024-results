Solar Gators was re-founded in 2016 by a small group of passionate engineering students that were determined to compete in FSGP the following year. Through lots of hard work, our first team went to competition in 2017 with our first car, Torch. For the following two years, we participated in the competition with modified versions of our first car, which we named Cielo. However, with the rise of the pandemic, we were not able to participate in the 2020 or 2021 competitions. Finally, in 2022, we were able to compete in FSGP with our 3rd ever solar vehicle, Sunrider. Using what we learned in 2022, we continued to improve Sunrider for the 2023 FSGP, and our hard work paid off when we placed first! That was the first ever podium placement in the history of Solar Gators, and we look forward to defending our title at the 2024 FSGP and participating in ASC for the first time with Sunrider.
