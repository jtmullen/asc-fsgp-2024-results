CalSol, the UC Berkeley Solar Vehicle Team, is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to design,
build, test, and race fully solar-powered vehicles. We have built 10 generations of solar cars over the past 34 years, racing them at national and international competitions. Composed of over 90 undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines, we provide students with hands-on experience in real-world engineering, project management, and business development.
