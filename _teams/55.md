The Esteban Project combines both creativity and perseverance toward an ambitious objective since its inception: developing the most competitive electric car powered entirely by the sun. Every year, our team must   ingeniously surpass itself to build an ever more performing prototype, thus adding its contribution to the development of sustainable energy sources. Today, the Esteban Project is proud to compete in the American Solar Challenge competition with Polytechnique Montreal’s latest solar car prototype: Esteban 11!
