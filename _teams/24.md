Established in 1988, Midnight Sun is University of Waterloo’s solar car team. Consisting of over 100 members across mechanical, electrical, business, and strategy sub-teams, the team is proud to present its latest vehicle, MS XV, as a cornerstone in the team’s return to the Single-Occupant Vehicle class and the first vehicle built in the last five years.

The team is very excited to participate in FSGP/ASC 2024 and hopes to gain valuable experience to pass on to future generations of the team!
