The University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project has been building solar cars since 1990. Made up entirely of undergraduate students, the team takes pride in cars that are nearly 100% designed and built by students, from the composites and solar array to the custom motors and batteries. As the defending champions of the American Solar Challenge MOV Class, the team returns this summer with their 15th car, Gaia, which recently took second place in the 2023 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge Cruiser Class.
