The ISU Solar Car Racing Team is devoted to designing, building, and racing student-built solar powered vehicles. We were founded in 2005 by a few aspiring students as one of a handful of teams which compete from a university without an engineering program. The goal of the team is to let students gain practical experience and skills outside of the traditional classroom while promoting sustainable energy.
