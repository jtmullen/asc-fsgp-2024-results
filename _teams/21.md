Our team, SolarCar at Virginia Tech, was founded in the Fall semester of 2021, reviving a previous solar vehicle team from the 1990â€™s at the university. After focusing on establishing our organization and building the team that first semester, we began designing our first vehicle, the Sun Gobbler. Design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing was then completed over the past two years in preparation for our first competition this summer!

We would like to thank everyone who has made this experience possible, including all our team members, alumni, advisors, the university, and our sponsors. We would not be here without all your support!
