Established in 1992, the Eclipse ETS team has been on a sun-fuelled journey for over three decades.

At Eclipse ETS, we meld ambition with meticulous craftsmanship, pouring our passion into every detail of our solar car. Eclipse XI showcases our commitment to excellence and pioneering sustainable energy technologies. Our design philosophy reflects our aspiration to influence change: we strive to harness our resources to their full potential, focusing always on the horizon of the future. Eclipse XI, with its immaculate construction and innovative design, stands testament to this vision, aiming to inspire the industry towards a norm of renewable energy and sustainable transport. 

What sets our team apart is our rich diversity in skills and adaptability, embodied in the spirit of the École de technologie supérieure (ETS). As proud representatives of Québec and Canada, we operate as an 'équipe polyvalente.' This French phrase denotes a multi-talented team, where a mechanical engineer might lend a hand in electrical matters, or vice versa. Our solar car, therefore, is a testament to cross-disciplinary collaboration and Québécois ingenuity.
