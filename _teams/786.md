The Sunseeker Solar Car Project was founded in 1990 during the beginning of competitive solar car racing. The team provides challenging opportunities for WMU students to design, build, and race solar vehicles. The team has competed annually in the Formula Sun Grand Prix, and biennially in the American Solar Challenge. The team has sat out of only two races in its 30-year history. WMU has built ten solar cars and will be completing its eleventh, the 2023 vehicle.
