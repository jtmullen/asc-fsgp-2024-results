The Bridger Solar Team was founded in 2017 by a group of electrical engineering students. The first-generation vehicle was designed and built in the initial two-year period with the intent of competing in the 2018 Formula Sun Grand Prix; however, due to design and budget concerns, the team decided not to attend the competition. The current vehicle is in the second round of design and was intended to compete in the 2021 competition but due to Covid-19, the vehicle was not finished in time for the race. The team is now on track to compete in the 2024 Formula Sun grand Prix.
