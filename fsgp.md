## Multi-Occupant Vehicle Class

In the Multi-Occupant Class vehicles are scored on a number of factors including:
- Target Speed (teams must average at least 30mph, if they do not their score is reduced)
- Total Person Laps (each additional passenger in the vehicle for a compeleted lap earns an additonal person lap)
- External Energy Usage (MOV cars can charge from non-solar sources, the amount of charging factors into the score)

<b>Results:</b>
- 1st: #55 Polytechnique Montréal  135.4 points / 1355 person miles (270 laps)
- 2nd: #35 University of Minnesota  35.0 points / 1475 person miles (295 laps)

### MOV Score
<i>Scores will be updated daily at the end of the day</i>

<div style="margin:auto; text-align:center;"> <i> Scroll right to see all data on small screens </i></div>
{% include fsgp-score-table %}

#### Scoring Formula
At FSGP the MOV Score (S) is calculated as follows: **S = (D / E) x C x T**

The variables are as follows:
- **T** - Target Speed derating. For teams averaging below 30 mph their score is exponentially derated based on their average speed 
- **D** - Total Personal Miles (Person Laps * 2.5 miles) minus penalty miles
- **E** - External Energy Used in kWh
- **C** - Completion Factor as a percentage of the highest miles completed by any team
<i>Note for teams: See the regulations for full details, information here is simplified</i>
