_Note: While it is our intention that this google map is the correct route, teams must always defer to the Official Route Book for the Official Route. In the case of last minute detours this map may not be updated during the event_

## Checkpoint and Stage Stop Information

Please note that checkpoint and stage stops open at the earliest possible time that a solar car could arrive. For many reasons (weather, traffic, strategy) it is unlikely that any teams will arrive at the opening time. In some cases, such as poor weather or traffic conditions, no teams may arrive for several hours into the opening times. The later hours of a checkpoint and stage stop will see the most traffic, please plan accordingly. The [live tracker](./live) will have the most up to date information about team locations and can be used to estimate arrival times to the stops.
